# Muhammad Iqbal - Data-analysis-portofolio
## About
Hi, Iâ€™m Iqbal! I have a background in marketing, data analysis, business intelligence, and I am currently on track to complete my Digital Business (BA. Digital Business) degree. I have developed a strong foundation in the life sciences and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. As an entry-level data specialist, I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to data analysis and business intelligence. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in laboratory techniques, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role as a data specialist.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques and am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.

My CV is in [pdf](https://github.com/tiannaparris/Data-Analysis-Portfolio/blob/main/Tianna%20Parris%20CV.pdf).

This is a repository for showcasing skills, sharing projects, and tracking my progress in Data Analytics and data science-related topics.
